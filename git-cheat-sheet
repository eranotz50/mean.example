git status - local non commited
git add .  - add all
git commit -m "your message" -- commit to local repository
git rm -r --cached .idea -- example remove directory from repository.

git commit -a -m "renamed view"  -- a renamed view is added + old is deleted. for some reason it does not add the deleted one. -a forces this to be addded.
